### FAQ
Q.  What is C++ STL ?  
 A. C++ STL is a library provided by C++ that contains templated containers for implementing useful and important Data Structures and algorithms.

Q. Why use C++ STL ?  
A. C++ STL provides a wide range of containers with great implementation for necessary data structures, hence providing optimized performance and safe data handling.

Q. Did I use AI to assist me in code ?  
A. Yes I did use AI and it helped me a lot from finding bugs, fixing errors to explaining concepts. I used [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).
